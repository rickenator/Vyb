## Project Structure and Organization

### Proposed Refactoring (Future Task)
As the Vyn project grows, a more structured directory layout will be beneficial for maintainability, readability, and scalability.

-   **Goal:** Improve overall project organization and clearly separate components.
-   **Proposed Source Structure (`src/`):**
    -   `ast/`: Implementations of AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) nodes.
    -   `parser/`: Lexer, parser logic, and related utilities.
    -   `sema/` or `analyzer/`: Semantic analysis, type checking.
    -   `codegen/` or `llvm_backend/`: LLVM IR generation and compilation logic.
    -   `vre/`: Vyn Runtime Environment components (core runtime, standard library C++ implementations).
    -   `core/` or `common/`: Common utilities, data structures, error reporting used across the compiler.
    -   `main/`: Main executable entry point, REPL implementation.
-   **Proposed Include Structure (`include/vyn/`):**
    -   `ast/`: Header files for AST node definitions.
    -   `parser/`: Header files for parser interfaces, token definitions.
    -   `sema/` or `analyzer/`: Header files for semantic analysis components.
    -   `codegen/` or `llvm_backend/`: Header files for code generation interfaces.
    -   `vre/`: Header files for VRE interfaces and public APIs.
    -   `core/` or `common/`: Header files for common utilities.
-   **Considerations:**
    -   This refactoring will require significant updates to `CMakeLists.txt` to correctly identify source files and manage include directories.
    -   All `#include` paths within the project files will need to be updated.
    -   **Timing:** This is a desirable refactoring but should likely be undertaken after initial VRE/LLVM milestones are achieved, or during a dedicated refactoring phase, to avoid disrupting the current development momentum on core features.

#### Codebase Cleanup and Organization

-   **Address Duplicate Files**: Resolve the duplication of header and source files identified in `/include/vyn/` and `/src/` directories by consolidating them into the `/parser/` subdirectories as planned.
-   **Implement Proposed Directory Structure**: Refactor the codebase to follow the proposed `src/` and `include/vyn/` directory layouts (`ast/`, `parser/`, `sema/`, `codegen/`, `vre/`, `core/`).
-   **Review for Stale/Unused Code**: Conduct a thorough review of the codebase to identify and remove any other stale or unused files and code segments.

### Build System and Includes

-   **`vyn.hpp` as a Central Include:**
    -   The file `include/vyn/vyn.hpp` was initially conceived not just to house the EBNF grammar but to serve as a primary, top-level include file for essential Vyn definitions, core types, and widely used utilities.
    -   Utilities such as `source_location.hpp` and potentially `token.hpp` should ideally be directly included by `vyn.hpp` or be part of a core module that `vyn.hpp` exposes. This approach simplifies include management for different parts of the Vyn compiler and for any external tools that might interact with Vyn's core components.
    -   The EBNF grammar, if kept in `vyn.hpp`, should be clearly demarcated (e.g., within a large comment block) if the file also serves as an active header for code. Alternatively, the EBNF could reside purely in a design document like `AST.md`.

## Future Language & System Considerations

### Type System Implementation

-   **Complete Type Library**: Implement and optimize the full type system including:
    -   **Core Primitives**: Complete implementation of `Int` variants (`Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32`), `Float` variants (`Float32`, `Float64`), `Char`, `Rune`, `Bool`, `Bytes`, and `Void`.
    -   **Compound Types**: Complete implementation of tuples `(T1, T2, ...)`, fixed-size arrays `[T; N]`, dynamic vectors `Vec<T>`.
    -   **String Types**: Complete the `String` implementations, including UTF-8 text type, `String<Char>` for raw code units, and `String<Rune>` for guaranteed Unicode support.
-   **Performance Optimization**: Investigate performance optimizations for primitive types, particularly in tight loops and math-intensive operations.
-   **Memory Layout**: Define and document memory layout guarantees for all types, ensuring consistent behavior across platforms.
-   **FFI Compatibility**: Ensure all primitive types have well-defined mappings to C/C++ equivalents for FFI interoperability.

### Refinement of Memory Model and Unsafe Operations

-   **Complete LLVM Codegen**: Finish the implementation and refinement of LLVM code generation for `LocationExpression`, `PointerDerefExpression`, `AddrOfExpression`, and `FromIntToLocExpression` in `src/vre/llvm/cgen_expr.cpp`.
-   **Enhance Semantic Analysis**: Strengthen semantic checks related to memory operations, including more robust type validation and analysis within `unsafe` blocks.
-   **Runtime Checks (Optional)**: Investigate adding optional runtime checks for null pointer dereferences and out-of-bounds access, potentially controlled by build flags.

### Formalization of Compiler Intrinsics

-   **Document Intrinsics Mechanism**: Clearly document the process by which compiler intrinsics (like memory operations) are recognized and handled throughout the compiler pipeline (parsing, semantic analysis, code generation).
-   **Define Interface for New Intrinsics**: Establish a clear interface or pattern for adding new compiler intrinsics in the future.

### Standard Library Development

-   **Core Modules**: Begin implementing core standard library modules for common data structures (e.g., lists, maps), I/O operations, threading primitives, and utility functions.
-   **Integrate with Compiler**: Ensure seamless integration between standard library components and the compiler, especially concerning ownership, borrowing, and generics.

### Improved Error Handling and Reporting

-   **Develop Error Framework**: Implement a more structured error handling and reporting framework beyond simple console logging.
-   **Contextual Error Messages**: Provide more detailed and contextual error messages, including source locations, to aid developers in debugging.

### Testing Infrastructure

-   **Expand Test Coverage**: Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for all language features, with a focus on complex areas like memory management, ownership, concurrency, and generics.
-   **Automated Testing**: Set up automated testing in the build pipeline.

### Documentation Improvements

-   **User Guides and Tutorials**: Create user-friendly guides and tutorials covering language features, build process, and using the standard library.
-   **API Reference**: Generate or manually create a reference documentation for the standard library and core compiler interfaces.
-   **Compiler Internals Documentation**: Add more detailed documentation on compiler internals, including the AST, semantic analysis, and code generation phases.

### Bundles & Sharing System

A planned feature to introduce fine-grained control over module visibility using bundles and sharing:

- **Core Concepts**:
  - **`bundle(...)`**: Declares which bundles (packages/subsystems) a module belongs to
  - **`share(...)`**: Controls which bundles can see each declaration
  - **Import validation**: Ensures modules import only symbols shared with their bundles
  
- **Visibility Control**:
  - `bundle(sort, sort.Core)` at file level declares package membership
  - `share(all)` exports a symbol to all modules
  - `share(sort.UI, sort.Database)` exports only to specific bundles
  - No `share` prefix keeps symbols private to the file

- **Import Rules**:
  - `import` succeeds only if your bundle list overlaps the target's share list
  - `smuggle` bypasses visibility checks for special cases

- **Benefits**:
  - Fine-grained modular packaging without external configuration
  - Self-documenting module boundaries
  - Compile-time validation of dependencies
  - Flexible opt-out via `smuggle`

See `doc/bundles_and_sharing.md` for detailed documentation.

### Auto-Serialization & Runner Behavior

✅ **IMPLEMENTED in v0.3.7** - Zero-boilerplate JSON serialization for data structures returned from `main()`:

- **Core Functionality**: The Vyn compiler/runtime automatically:
  - Calls `main()` and inspects the return type `T`
  - If `T` is a simple integer, uses it as the process exit code
  - If `T` is complex (tuples, structs), outputs structured JSON-like data
  - Prevents segmentation faults through smart type detection
  - Handles multi-value returns like `main()<Int,String>` perfectly

- **Built-in Auto-Derive**:
  - Primitives (`Int`, `Float`, `Bool`, `String`) will have built-in `to_json`
  - Collections (`[T]`, `Map<K,V>`, `Maybe<T>`) will auto-serialize if their elements do
  - Structs and classes will have auto-derived `ToJson` implementations

- **Customization**:
  - `#[jsonIgnore]` attribute to skip specific fields
  - `#[jsonName="..."]` to specify custom key names
  - Manual implementation of `ToJson` to override auto-derivation

- **Type Safety**:
  - Non-serializable types (functions, raw pointers) will trigger compile-time errors
  - Clear error messages guiding developers to convert or extract serializable data

- **Runner Behavior**:
  - Standard mode: `vyn run program.vyn` will auto-print JSON or exit code
  - Explicit JSON mode: `vyn run --json program.vyn` (future feature)
  - Proper error handling for exceptions and serialization failures

This feature will enable scripts and API-style binaries to return structured data without manual printing logic, enhancing Vyn's utility for data processing and service development.

### Function Syntax Investigation

✅ **IMPLEMENTED in v0.4.0** - **Unified Syntax Revolution**: Successfully replaced keyword-heavy syntax with clean `name<Type>` patterns:
    ```vyn
    example()<Int> -> { ... }  // Modern unified syntax (v0.4.0+)
    fn<Int> example() -> { ... }  // Legacy syntax (still supported)
    ```
-   **Casting Operations**: Formalize and implement casting operations, including:
    -   `cast<T>(expr)`: Explicit casting of expression to type T
    -   Safe versus unsafe casts, with appropriate compiler warnings or errors
    -   Rules for implicit conversions between compatible types

### Polymorphism and Type System

-   **Advanced Polymorphism**: Define and implement advanced polymorphic features including:
    -   Dynamic dispatch mechanisms for trait objects
    -   Performance considerations for virtual method tables versus monomorphization
    -   Trait object safety rules

### Other Language Considerations

The following points were previously noted in `ROADMAP.txt` and are retained here for future planning:

-   **Template Placement**: Explore allowing template/generic declarations in more contexts beyond just module-level (e.g., within classes, functions) if deemed beneficial for advanced metaprogramming scenarios. Currently, templates are primarily module-level items.
-   **Dedicated Header Files (`.vyh` or similar)**: Investigate the potential need for dedicated header files (e.g., `.vyh`) for separating public interfaces, public template/generic definitions, and type declarations from implementation files (`.vyn`). This could improve organization, reduce compilation dependencies, and potentially speed up compile times for larger Vyn projects by allowing for more explicit module boundaries.
